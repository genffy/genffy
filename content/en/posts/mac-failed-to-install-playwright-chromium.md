When install `pnpm install playwright-chromium` always pending like this:

```
The solution is try to manual install `chromium` and `ffmpeg`, the deitails: detailsï¼šhttps://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/playwright-chromium/install.js

[download it](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/) directly

```bash
tar: Error opening archive: Failed to open '/path/to/xxxx.tar.gz'
# tar --extract --no-same-owner --file /path/to/xxxx.tar.gz --directory /private/tmp/yyyyy
